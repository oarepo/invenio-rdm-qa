/**
 * This script runs after all Playwright tests have completed. Its main purpose is to inspect the overall test run status and modify the process exit code if any tests failed.
 * 
 * Specifically:
 * - If there are failed tests (status !== 0), it reads the Playwright JSON test report to count the failed tests.
 * - It appends a summary of failed tests to the GitHub Actions step summary file (if running in GitHub Actions environment).
 * - It overrides the exit code to 0 to prevent the CI pipeline from failing, allowing manual handling or further processing of test results.
 * 
 * This approach is useful in pipelines where you want to collect and report test failures but not necessarily stop the entire workflow immediately.
