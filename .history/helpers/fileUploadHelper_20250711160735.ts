/**
 * This helper class provides utility functions to manage file uploads during Playwright tests.
 * 
 * Main responsibilities:
 * - Dynamically determine the path to the folder containing files for upload (`data/UploadFiles`).
 * - Ensure that this upload folder exists, creating it if necessary.
 * - Provide a method to randomly select a file from the upload folder and upload it via the web page.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate this class with a Playwright Page object.
 * - Call `uploadRandomFile()` to pick a random file from the folder and upload it via the file input element on the page.
 * 
 * This helper encapsulates the file upload logic, making tests cleaner and more maintainable.
